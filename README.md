- 👋 Hi, I’m @LukeParkhurst
- 👀 I’m interested in way too many things! However, I primarily stick to programming, working out and reading or writing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to utilize the MERN stack
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, especially fun projects that relate to some form of story telling. But I am open to anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: ParkhurstL95@outlook.com
